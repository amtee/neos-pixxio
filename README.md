# pixx.io adaptor for Neos 4.x

This [Flow](https://flow.neos.io) package allows you to use assets (ie. pictures and other documents) stored in [pixx.io](https://www.pixxio-bildverwaltung.de/)
in your Neos website as if these assets were native Neos assets.

## About pixx.io
pixx.io offers an intelligent solution for digital asset management. The software makes working with
pictures, graphics and video files easier. pixx.io is safe, efficient and easy to understand and handle.

## Key Features

- authentication setup via own backend module
- seamless integration into the Neos media browser
- automatic import and clean up of media assets from pixx.io

## Installation

The pixx.io connector is installed as a regular Flow package via Composer. For your existing
project, simply include `flownative/neos-pixxio` into the dependencies of your Flow or Neos distribution:

For Neos 4.*:

```bash
$ composer require flownative/neos-pixxio:~1.0
```

## Enabling pixx.io API access

The API access is configured by three components:

1. a setting which contains the customer-specific service endpoint URL
2. a setting providing the pixx.io API key
3. a setting providing the pixx.io user refresh token

First define the customer-specific service endpoint by adding the URL to your settings:

```yaml
Neos:
  Media:
    assetSources:
      'flownative-pixxio':
        assetSource: 'Flownative\Pixxio\AssetSource\PixxioAssetSource'
        assetSourceOptions:
          apiEndpointUri: 'https://flownative.pixxio.media/cgi-bin/api/pixxio-api.pl'
```

You will likely just replace "flownative" by our own subdomain.

Next, add the pixx.io API key and the refresh token of the pixx.io user you want to connect with Neos:

```yaml
Neos:
  Media:
    assetSources:
      'flownative-pixxio':
        assetSource: 'Flownative\Pixxio\AssetSource\PixxioAssetSource'
        assetSourceOptions:
          apiEndpointUri: 'https://flownative.pixxio.media/cgi-bin/api/pixxio-api.pl'
          apiKey: 'abcdef123456789'
          sharedRefreshToken: 'A3ZezMq6Q24X314xbaiq5ewNE5q4Gt'
```

When you committed and deployed these changes, you can log in to the Neos backend and navigate to the pixx.io backend
module to verify your settings.
  
If you would like a separate pixx.io user for the logged in Neos user, you can copy and paste your own "refresh token"
into the form found in the backend module and store it along with your Neos user.

When everything works out fine, Neos will report that the connection was successful (and if not, you'll see an error
message with further details).

## Additional configuration options

During import, Neos tries to use a medium-sized version of the original instead of the high resolution file uploaded to
pixx.io. This greatly improves import speed and produces good results in most cases. Furthermore, this way some formats,
like Adobe Photoshop, can be used seamlessly in Neos without the need to prior converting them into a web-compatible image
format.

It is possible though, to configure this plugin to always use the high-res original for import. By default, formats like SVG or PDF
are imported this way. You can add more types through the similar entries like in the following settings:

```yaml
Neos:
  Media:
    assetSources:
      'flownative-pixxio':
        assetSource: 'Flownative\Pixxio\AssetSource\PixxioAssetSource'
        assetSourceOptions:
          mediaTypes:
            'image/svg+xml':
              usePixxioThumbnailAsOriginal: true
            'application/pdf':
              usePixxioThumbnailAsOriginal: true
```

## Run database migrations
```bash
./flow doctrine:migrate
``` 

## Cleaning up unused assets

Whenever a pixx.io asset is used in Neos, the media file will be copied automatically to the internal Neos asset
storage. As long as this media is used somewhere on the website, Neos will flag this asset as being in use. 
When an asset is not used anymore, the binary data and the corresponding metadata can be removed from the internal
storage. While this does not happen automatically, it can be easily automated by a recurring task, such as a cron-job.

In order to clean up unused assets, simply run the following command as often as you like:

```bash
./flow media:removeunused --asset-source flownative-pixxio
``` 

If you'd rather like to invoke this command through a cron-job, you can add two additional flags which make this
command non-interactive:

```bash
./flow media:removeunused --quiet --assume-yes --asset-source flownative-pixxio
```
